# favicon-finder

in this project I tried to get the favicon of different websites given by the user but mid way I got the cors error which is a bit annoying and hard to get through I tried all the methods I can find on the internet but the one that worked for me is using the chrome extension called cors unblock I don't know if it will work when I host it on a server but I learned a lot while doing this project how to access html and css elements using javascript and what is cors and how to get around cors

limitations of this project

    this website can't find all the favicons, Like for twitter it will give the error message if i try to get favicon of twitter, This is happening because it has something to do with server side i think and if you try to get the favicon of the chatgpt it will give something which is  circle and a arrow in the middle which is not the favicon of chatgpt and if the user enters a different name like if he/she want to get the favicon of git he/she need to enter the site name as git-scm which is not ideal and should be resolved by me. So there are some thing which need some work. I made this project to implement what i have learn and gain some knowledge. I have tried to solve all the problems that I possible can, There are many more things that I need to learn I will try to fix all the problems as soon as I find the solution.

upgrades that can be done

    instead of asking the name of the website I can ask for an URL which will make more sense as it might return the accurate results rather than asking for the name because every website doesn't start with www and end with .com so I will work on it and I also need to update the css of the website as of 11 august 2023

thank you for reading me :)
